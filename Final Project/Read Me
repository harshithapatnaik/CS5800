“DidIt” Daily Task Tracker App:

DidIt is a mobile application designed to help users organize and track their daily tasks effectively. 
The app features a sleek and intuitive interface, providing a calendar view to navigate through months and view tasks for specific dates. 
Each day's task screen includes a "To-Do" list for tasks yet to be completed and a "DidIt's" list for tasks already done. 
Users can add, edit, or delete tasks seamlessly through the app. 
Additionally, the progress of tasks is visualized with a pie chart, offering users a quick snapshot of their productivity. 

DidIt is envisioned as a flexible and scalable tool, with plans to introduce advanced features like task prioritization, reminders, and collaboration in future versions.
